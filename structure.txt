1) Init data structure

Initiates data struct :

- fills data with argv : nb_philos, t_tdie, t_teat t_tsleep, nb_teat

2) Launch mutexes

Calls pthreads_mutex_init() the same nb of times as the nb of philosophers
pthread_mutex_init(&forks[i], NULL)

3) Init philos

Initializes the philosopher struct:

Giving access to data to each philosopher (needed for access to t_teat, etc)

Giving access to mutexes for left and right forks to each philosopher

Giving access to mutex_write to each philosopher (using mutex 200)

4) Launch threads

Calling pthread_create and pthread_join

Creates each philosopher's thread

5) Destroy threads
